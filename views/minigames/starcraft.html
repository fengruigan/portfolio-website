		This game contains a lot of assets that do not belong to me, and I do not claim the ownership of anything other than the idea of the game and the scripts.

		If you have seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CarbotAnimations"><strong>Carbot Animation</strong></a> (a great Youtube Channel), you probably have already recognized the cute marine and zerglings. All the sprites are cut out with Photoshop. The BGM and sound effects all come from the Internet. BGM, marine and zergling dialogs all come from <a href="http://www.hazmatt.net/gaming/starcraft/index.html"><strong>hazmatt.net</strong></a>. The gun sound is (I believe) the AUG sound from Counter-Strike (unfortunately, I can't find the source, please feel free to contact me if this violates your copyrights)

	</h2>
	<hr class="smooth">
	<p>
		This game was the final project for a Java course back in high school. The game was originally made with <strong>Greenfoot</strong>. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I made this game in three days. I was a real rookie in making games (and coding) at that time, so I just thought of the easiest thing to make, and tried to make it somewhat fun to play. I was very much addicted to <strong>Starcraft</strong> and <strong>Carbot Animation</strong> at the time, so that was what I went for.
	<p>
		
	</p>
	<p>
		Making the game was quite a bit harder than I thought. I went for the easiest game to make in terms of coding, I only had to code the movements, random spawning, and simple collision detections (simply detect with object positions). But I still had to code the animation frame by frame. I had to screen shot each frame and cut them out with photoshop (sorry Carbot). 
	</p>
	<p>
		The earliest version of the game had an issue of losing the game even though zerglings did not touch the marine, which was caused by me not properly resizing the image after cutting out the white spaces, causing error in collision detection. Also, the player had to hold down the "r" key to reload because otherwise, the animation would not play properly (I did not know how to code call back functions at that time).
	</p>
	<p>
		A surprise for me was that I won the "first prize" by popular voting with this game in my class. It was not really a competition, but it was still a rewarding experience.
	</p>
	<p>
		Recently, I remade this game with <a href="http://cocos.com/cocoscreator" title="cocos creator"><strong>Cocos Creator</strong></a> when I was learning about the engine, and this is the version you are seeing. The game is definitely still buggy, I only went so far as to recreate what I had, and have not yet spend any time optimizing it. I probably should, but that will likely be done in the future.

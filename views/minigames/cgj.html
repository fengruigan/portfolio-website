			The 2020 CiGA Game Jam lasted 48 hours from 6 a.m. EDT Aug 14 to 6 a.m. Aug 16. The event was hosted in China and mainly targeted participants in China.
		</p>
		<p>
			I heard of the event from a college friend of mine, who also participated in the event. I joined the event mostly because I wanted some projects to do so that I can write something on my resume (and of course, practice my coding skills), and it turned out to be much more exciting than I first expected.

			Before I dive too deep into the back story of the game, let's first have a play!

			简介：
		</h3>
		<p>
			这是一场天灾，还是人为，莉莉丝不清楚，她只知道她家的房子正在被巨型蚂蚁撕开口子，源源不断的蚂蚁从裂缝中涌入。玩家需要利用空投的物资，保护莉莉丝，just do it！
		</p>
		<p>
			保护莉莉丝到空投防护服并逃出去，或者利用箱子填满20条裂缝。箱子可以阻挡蚂蚁。
		</p>
		<h3 style="text-align: left">
			操作（电脑）：
		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>使用方向键移动</li>

			The Game:
		</h3>
		<p>
			Is this an apocalypse? Or is it manmade? Lilith does not yet know. All she can tell is that her house is being torn apart by giant ants, and they are pouring through the breach. The player needs to utilize the resources from airdrops to help Lilith survive this whatever it is. Just do it!
		</p>
		<p>
			Protect Lilith until a hazmat suit is dropped, pick it up and escape the house! Or fill 20 breaches with boxes. Boxes can also be used to block ants.
		</p>
		<h3 style="text-align: left">
			Controls (computer):
		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Use Arrow keys to move</li>
			<li>Press "Z" to pick up and drop down items</li>
		</ul>

			Because my friend's team was already full, I had to team up with kind strangers who were willing take me in even though I am a rookie. This was our team:

			Similar to <strong><em><a href="https://ldjam.com/">Ludum Dare</a></em></strong>, participants are shown a picture as the theme of the contest, and we needed to make our own game within 48 hours based on that theme. It is up to us to interpret the picture, but we need to be able to relate back to the theme in the end, unlike Ludum Dare where it is not a requirement to follow the theme (though you would get lower scores).
		</p>
		<p>
			The theme of this contest was:
		</p>
		<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em">
			<img src="/images/CGJ_theme.png" class="image">
		</div>
		<p>
			We first came up with a few options for genres. Because we were using <a href="http://cocos.com/cocoscreator" title="cocos creator"><strong>Cocos Creator</strong></a> as our game engine, we chose to make a 2d game which the engine excels at. We came up with mystery/puzzle game like <strong><em>Rusty Lake</em></strong> (because the theme picture gave us that vibe), 2d-platformer/action game (maybe like pac-man), and finally 2d-tower-defense game. Obviously, we went for the last option.  
		</p>
		<p>
			After settling down for the genre, we started digging into details. We all came to the consensus that traditional tower defense would be too dull to play, so we decided to incorporate elements of <strong><em>Orcs Must Die</em></strong>, which is an RPG style tower defense. 
		</p>

			That was most of the comments we got so far. You were probably thinking the same thing too. Unfortunately did not have much time to balance the game as we were running out of time, not to mention balancing the game was never a goal for the contest. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Our team is thinking about improving the game, such as making a quick and simple guide/tutorial, so please wait for future updates if you are still interested. And if you have any pressing comments, please feel free to contact me (you can contact my email, sorry I don't have a comment section setup yet), or you can head over to the <a href="https://www.youxibd.com/gamejam/cgjcyber2020/detail/315"><strong>CiGA Game Jam official site</strong></a> to leave a comment

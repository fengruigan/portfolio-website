# portfolio-website
This is a personal website created by Fengrui (Simon) Gan
The main goal of this website is to show case some of the projects that I have made.
I also intend to make this website a physics playground, where viewers can play physics demonstration/simulations while reading about physics.
Hopefully viewers can learn something about physics while playing.
